HOW TO INSTALL ZIP
     Zip is distributed as C source code that can be compiled on a
     wide range of Unix machines, VAXes running VMS, and MSDOS
     machines using Microsoft or Borland C++, and OS/2 machines using
     Microsoft C.  You will need Unzip 5.0p1 (under Unix, MSDOS, or VMS)
     or PKUNZIP 2.04g or later (under MSDOS) to unpack the distribution
     file, zip201.zip. But since you read this, you have unpacked it
     already, or you cheated and got a tar.Z file...

     Let's assume however that you start from scratch and have not yet
     unpacked the sources. First, unpack the source as follows,
     assuming that you have zip201.zip in the current directory.

          mkdir zipsrc
          cd zipsrc
          unzip ../zip201

     This extracts all source files and documentation in the
     directory called "zipsrc". If you wish to build a version
     of zip with encryption capabilities, you must also get the
     separate package zcrypt20.zip and uncomment the definition
     of MAKE at the beginning of the makefile.

     You then do:

          make system

     where "system" is one of: generic, 386bsd, 3b1, aix, att6300, aux, bsd,
     bsdold, bull, convex, coherent, cray, cray_v3, dec_osf1, dnix,
     dynix, hpux, isc, linux, minix, next10, next2x, next3x, nextfat, pixel,
     ptx, rs6000, scodos, sco_x286, sgi, sun, sun_gcc, sysv, sysv_gcc,
     sysv_386, sys_386_gcc, sysv_old, ultrix, v7, xenix, xos, zilog.
     Try "make generic" first, this works on most systems. If this
     fails, then use one of the special targets given above.

     If you are using a NeXT, then make next for help about various
     NeXT targets.  Among other special systems are HPUX, DNIX 5.2 or
     5.3, Cray Unicos, AT&T 3B1 (also known as Unix PC or PC 7300),
     Zilog Zeus, A/UX, Convex, AIX, MINIX, ISC System V/386, Dynix,
     Ultrix and DEC OSF/1.

     If you are using BSD Unix, try bsd.  If the linker cannot find
     _memset or _memcpy, try bsdold or v7.  If you are using System V
     Unix or SCO Unix, try sysv or sysv_old.  Also use sysv on a
     Silicon Graphics (SGI) machine.  You can also cross-compile Zip
     for MSDOS under SCO 386 Unix using "make scodos". If you get
     error messages "constant expected" in deflate.c, add -DDYN_ALLOC
     to CFLAGS in your makefile entry.

     If you have lots of memory, try compiling with -DBIG_MEM. If your
     system supports mmap(), try compiling with -DMMAP. This generally
     gives faster compression but uses more memory. See the Makefile
     entry mmap_gcc for an example.

     If none of these compiles, links, and functions properly on
     your Unix system, see the file README for how to get help.

     If the appropriate system was selected, then the executables
     zip, zipnote and zipsplit will be created.  You can copy them
     to an appropriate directory in the search path using:

          make install

     The defaults are /usr/local/bin for the executables and
     /usr/man/man1 for the manual page. Change the macros BINDIR
     and MANDIR in makefile if appropriate.

     You can use the command "set" to see the current search
     path.  If you are using the C-Shell (csh), enter the com-
     mand:

          rehash

     so csh can find the new command in the path.  You are now
     ready to use Zip.

     You can get rid of the now unnecessary source and object
     files with:

          cd ..
          rm -r zipsrc

     This will remove the directory zip and its contents created
     by unzip.  You should keep the zip20.zip file around though,
     in case you need to build it again or want to give it to a
     colleague.

     You can add the following lines to the file /etc/magic for
     usage by the 'file' command:

0	string		PK\003\004	Zip archive
>4	string		\011		(at least v0.9 to extract)
>4	string		\012		(at least v1.0 to extract)
>4	string		\013		(at least v1.1 to extract)
>4	string		\024		(at least v2.0 to extract)


     The steps for installation under MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS are
     similar to the above: first unzip the distribution files
     into their own directory. The system dependant files are
     stored in special subdirectories. You may have to
     copy or move them to the main sources directory.
     Then under MSDOS do one of:

          make makefile.msc
          make -fmakefile.bor

     for Microsoft or Borland C++, respectively. For Turbo C 2.0,
     use the configuration file tcconfig.tc, the batch file
     doturboc.bat and the project files zip.prj, zipnote.prj
     and zipsplit.prj. Make sure to use the compact model.

     Under OS/2:

          nmake -f makefile.os2

     for Microsoft C 6.00.  Under VAX VMS:

          @make_vaxc
     or:  @make_gcc

     For command help on any of the zip* utilities, simply enter
     the name with no arguments.
