                                      INTRODUCTION
                                      ============


          The GIFSAVE functions (hereafter called GIFSAVE) make it possible 
          to save GIF-images from your own graphic-producing C-programs.

              The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of 
              CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(tm) is a Service Mark property of 
              CompuServe Incorporated. 

          (According to CompuServe Inc, the above note must be included in 
          documentation of programs using GIF-files.)

          GIFSAVE creates simple GIF-files following the GIF87a standard. 
          Interlaced images can not be created, and there should only be one 
          image pr file.

                                      USING GIFSAVE
                                      =============


          GIFSAVE consists of four functions, all decleared in GIFSAVE.H:

              GIF_Create() creates new GIF-files. It takes parameters 
                  specifying the filename, screen size, number of colors, and 
                  color resolution. 

              GIF_SetColor() sets up the red, green and blue color 
                  components. It should be called once for each possible 
                  color. 

              GIF_CompressImage() performs the compression of the image. It 
                  accepts parameters describing the position and size of the 
                  image on screen, and a user defined callback function that 
                  is supposed to fetch the pixel values. 

              GIF_Close() terminates and closes the file. 

          The functions should be called in the listed order for each 
          GIF-file. One file must be closed before a new one can be created.


          To use these functions, you must create a callback function that 
          will do what is needed to get the pixel values for each point in 
          the image.





                                       PORTABILITY
                                       ===========


          GIFSAVE is written using streams only, and all word (16 bits) 
          outputs are split into byte outputs to force the byte swapping 
          required in GIF-files. This should make the functions rather 
          portable.

          File output is done through the functions Create(), Write(), 
          WriteByte(), WriteWord() and Close(). If you want to rewrite 
          GIFSAVE to use other file I/O than streams, you need only change 
          theese functions.

                                      THE FUNCTIONS
                                      =============


          GIF_Create() 

                  Function  Creates a new GIF-file, and stores info on the 
                            screen. 

                    Syntax  int GIF_Create(
                                    char *filename,
                                    int width, int height,
                                    int numcolors, int colorres
                                ); 

                   Remarks  Creates a new (or overwrites an existing) 
                            GIF-file with the given filename. No 
                            .GIF-extension is added.

                            The width- and height- parameters specifies the 
                            size of the screen.

                            numcolors is the number of colors used in the 
                            image.

                            colorres is number of bits used to encode a 
                            primary color (red, green or blue). In GIF-files, 
                            colors are built by combining given amounts of 
                            each primary color. On VGA-cards, each color is 
                            built by combining red, green and blue values in 
                            the range [0, 63]. Encoding the number 63 would 
                            require 6 bits, so colorres would be set to 6. 

              Return value  GIF_OK        - OK
                            GIF_ERRCREATE - Error creating file
                            GIF_ERRWRITE  - Error writing to file
                            GIF_OUTMEM    - Out of memory

          GIF_SetColor() 

                  Function  Specifies the primary color component of a color 
                            used in the image. 

                    Syntax  void GIF_SetColor(
                                     int colornum,
                                     int red, int green, int blue
                                 ); 

                   Remarks  This function updates the colortable-values for 
                            color number colornum in the image.

                            Should be called for each color in the range

                                [0, numcolors]

                            with red, green and blue components in the range

                                [0, (1 << colorres) - 1]

                            colorres and colornum are values previousely 
                            given to the function GIF_Create(). 

              Return value  None

          GIF_CompressImage() 

                  Function  Compresses an image and stores it in the current 
                            file. 

                    Syntax  int GIF_CompressImage(
                                    int left, int top,
                                    int width, int height,
                                    int (*getpixel)(int x, int y)
                                ); 

                   Remarks  The left- and top- parameters indicate the image 
                            offset from the upper left corner of the screen. 
                            They also give the start values for calls to the 
                            userdefined callback function.

                            width and height give the size of the image. A 
                            value of -1 indicates the equivalent screen size 
                            given in the call to GIF_Create().

                            If the image is supposed to cover the entire 
                            screen, values 0, 0, -1, -1 should be given.

                            GIF_CompressImage() obtains the pixel values by 
                            calling a user specified function. This function 
                            is passed in the parameter getpixel. See "THE 
                            CALLBACK FUNCTION" further down for a description 
                            of this function. 

              Return value  GIF_OK        - OK
                            GIF_ERRWRITE  - Error writing to file
                            GIF_OUTMEM    - Out of memory

          GIF_Close() 

                  Function  Closes the GIF-file. 

                    Syntax  int GIF_Close(void); 

                   Remarks  This function writes a terminating descriptor to 
                            the file, and then closes it. Also frees memory 
                            used by the other functions of GIFSAVE. 

              Return value  GIF_OK        - OK
                            GIF_ERRWRITE  - Error writing to file

                                  THE CALLBACK FUNCTION
                                  =====================


          callback() 

                  Function  Obtains pixel-values for the GIF_CompressImage() 
                            -function. 

                    Syntax  int callback(int x, int y); 

                   Remarks  This function (or these functions) must be 
                            written by the programmer using GIFSAVE. It 
                            should accept two integer parameters specifying a 
                            point on the screen, and return the pixel value 
                            at this point.

                            The ranges for these parameters are as follows:

                                x : [img_left, img_left + img_width - 1]
                                y : [img_top, img_top + img_height - 1]

                            where img_left, img_top, img_width and img_height 
                            are the values left, top, width and height passed 
                            to GIF_CompressImage().

                            An example; if the screen has width 640 and 
                            height 350, and the image covers the entire 
                            screen, x will be in the range [0, 639] and y in 
                            the range [0, 349].

                            Of course callback() need not get its values from 
                            the screen. The values can be fetched from a 
                            memory array, they can be calculated for each 
                            point requested, etc.

                            The function is passed as a parameter to 
                            GIF_CompressImage(), and can thus have any name, 
                            not only callback(). 

              Return value  Pixel value at the point requested. Should be in 
                            the range [0, numcolors - 1], where numcolors is 
                            as specified to the GIF_Create() -function.
