                    A dynamic-link library (DLL) is a library of functions
                    whose references are resolved at run time rather than
                    at compile time. DLL functions are dynamically linked
                    to a calling application.

                    Each application using statically linked code has its
                    own copy of the code. The code for functions defined in
                    a DLL is shared by all calling applications; only one
                    copy is placed in memory. Defining code shared by a
                    group of applications in a DLL therefore reduces the
                    size of the .EXEs of the calling applications.

                    You might want to define complex windowing behavior,
                    shared by a group of your applications, in an Object-
                    Windows DLL. In this chapter, you'll learn how to write
                    and use an ObjectWindows DLL. You'll also learn how to
                    use the ObjectWindows dynamic-link library (OWL31.DLL).



===========================================================================
C++ DLLs
===========================================================================

                    DLLs can contain ordinary functions or a combination of
                    functions and exported C++ classes. First, we'll
                    examine DLLs in the context of a library of ordinary
                    functions. This section contains an overview of Borland
                    C++ DLLs; you'll learn how to write, export, and call a
                    DLL function using Borland C++.


       Writing DLL
         functions  =======================================================

                    Windows requires that two functions be defined in every
                    DLL: LibMain and WEP (Windows Exit Procedure).






                                   - 1 -






------------------  You must supply the LibMain function, which is the main
   LibMain and WEP  entry point for a Windows DLL. Windows calls LibMain
                    once, when the library is first loaded. LibMain
------------------  initializes the DLL; this initialization depends almost
                    entirely on the particular DLL's function, but might
                    include the following tasks:

                    o unlocking the data segment with UnlockData, if it has
                      been declared as MOVEABLE

                    o setting up global variables for the DLL, if it uses
                      any

              Note  The DLL startup code C0Dx.OBJ initializes the local
                    heap automatically.

                    The following parameters are passed to LibMain:

                      int PASCAL LibMain(HANDLE hInstance, WORD wDataSeg,
                                         WORD cbHeapSize, LPSTR lpCmdLine)

 HANDLE, WORD, and  o hInstance is the instance handle of the DLL.
 LPSTR are defined
     in windows.h.  o wDataSeg is the value of the data segment (DS)
                      register.

                    o cbHeapSize is the size of the local heap specified in
                      the module definition file for the DLL.

                    o lpCmdLine is a far pointer to the command line
                      specified when the DLL was loaded. This is almost
                      always null, because typically DLLs are loaded
                      automatically without parameters. It is possible,
                      however, to supply a command line to a DLL when it is
                      loaded explicitly.

                    The return value for LibMain is either 1 (successful
                    initialization) or 0 (unsuccessful initialization).
                    Windows will unload the DLL from memory if the value is
                    0.

                    WEP is the exit point of a DLL; Windows calls it prior
                    to unloading the DLL. This function is not necessary in
                    a DLL (because the Borland C++ run-time libraries
                    provide a default one), but can be supplied by the
                    writer of a DLL to perform any cleanup of the DLL
                    before it is unloaded from memory.

                    Under Borland C++, WEP does not need to be exported.
                    This is the prototype for WEP:

                      int FAR PASCAL WEP (int nParameter)





                                   - 2 -






                    o nParameter is either WEP_SYSTEMEXIT (all of Windows
                      shuts down) or WEP_FREE_DLL (just this DLL is
                      unloaded).

                    WEP returns 1 to indicate success. Note that Windows
                    currently doesn't use this return value.


                    The additional functions defined in your DLL depend on
------------------  the services your DLL provides. When writing functions
      DLL-specific  that will be called from an application, you need to
         functions  keep these things in mind:

------------------  o Make calls to DLL functions far calls, and make
                      pointers specified as parameters and return values
                      far pointers. This is because a DLL has different
                      code and data segments than the calling application.

                    o Static data defined in a DLL is global to all calling
                      applications. Global data set by one caller can be
                      accessed by another. If you need data to be private
                      for a given caller, you need to dynamically allocate
                      and manage the data yourself.


     Exporting DLL
         functions  =======================================================

                    After writing your DLL functions, you must export the
                    functions that you want available to a calling
                    application. There are two steps involved: compiling
                    your DLL functions as exportable functions and
                    exporting them. You can do this in the following ways:

                    o If you flag a function with the _export keyword, it's
                      compiled as exportable and is then exported.

                    o If you don't flag a function with _export and you use
                      the -WD command-line switch or the Windows DLL All
                      Functions Exportable IDE option when compiling, the
                      function is compiled as exportable. However, the
                      function only gets exported if you also list it in
                      the EXPORTS section of the module definition (.DEF)
                      file.

                    o If you add the _export keyword to a class
                      declaration, the entire class (data and function
                      members) will be compiled as exportable and exported.

       Calling DLL  =======================================================
         functions
                    You call a DLL function within an application just as
                    you would call a function defined in the application
                    itself. However, you must import the DLL functions that
                    your application calls.

                    There are two ways to import a DLL function:

                    1. You can add an IMPORTS section to the calling
                       application's module definition (.DEF) file and list
                       the DLL function as an import.

                    2. You can link an import library that contains import
                       information for the DLL function to the calling
                       application. (Use IMPLIB to make the import
                       library.)

                    When your application is executed, the .DLL files for
                    the DLLs that it calls must be in the current
                    directory, on the path, or in the Windows or Windows
                    system directory; otherwise, your application won't
                    load.


ObjectWindows DLLs
                    =======================================================

                    ObjectWindows DLLs differ from ordinary DLLs in that,
                    with ObjectWindows DLLs, you export classes derived
                    from ObjectWindows classes as well as your own classes.
                    This makes those classes and their member functions
                    available to all .EXEs that dynamically link with your
                    DLL.

                    If you find that complex window behavior is shared by a
                    group of your applications, you can define this
                    behavior in an ObjectWindows DLL. For example, you
                    might build a DLL that defines

                    o a complex window used by related applications

                    o useful dialogs

                    o reusable custom controls

                    o common drawable controls

------------------  An instance of TModule acts as an object-oriented
 The module object  replacement for an ObjectWindows DLL. TModule member
                    functions provide support for window and memory
------------------  management and process errors.

                    Construct a module object in the LibMain function of
                    your DLL:

                      PTModule TheModule;

                      int FAR PASCAL LibMain(HANDLE hInstance, WORD,
                                             WORD cbHeapSize, LPSTR
                                             lpCmdLine)
                      {
                        int TheStatus;

                        TheModule = new TModule("LibName", hInstance,
                      lpCmdLine);
                        TheStatus = TheModule->Status;
                        if (TheStatus != 0)
                        {
                          TheModule->Error(TheStatus);
                          delete TheModule;
                          TheModule = NULL;
                        }

                        return (TheStatus == 0);
                      }

                    In this example LibMain, an instance of TModule is
                    constructed. The hInstance and lpCmdLine parameters
                    received from Windows are passed to the TModule
                    constructor to initialize data members of the same
                    name.

                    After the module object is constructed, its Status data
                    member is used to determine the success or failure of
                    module initialization. If the Status member contains a
                    nonzero value, the initialization of the module object
                    is unsuccessful. At this point, you should delete the
                    module object in LibMain; zero will be returned to
                    Windows to indicate that an error occurred (as shown
                    previously in LibMain). Set Status to an error that you
                    define (a nonzero value) if your DLL cannot be
                    successfully initialized.

                    In WEP, the module object is deleted:

                      int FAR PASCAL WEP(int)
                      {
                        delete TheModule;
                        return 1;





                                   - 5 -






                      }

                    As noted, Windows does not use WEP's return value.

                    Usually, your DLL will require additional
                    initialization and cleanup. You could perform this
                    processing in your LibMain and WEP functions; better
                    yet, derive a class from TModule. Perform the required
                    initialization and cleanup in its constructor and
                    destructor, and define data members for data global to
                    your DLL.


    Shared classes
                    =======================================================

                    You can share code that defines the behavior of a
                    general-use dialog box by defining a dialog class in a
                    DLL (a shared class). For example, a group of graphics
                    applications might use a color dialog defined in a DLL
                    to retrieve an RGB value from the user. To do so,
                    you'll need to export the class from the DLL and import
                    the class into your applications.


                    You'll need to do the following in order to
------------------  successfully define and declare a shared class.
     Declaring and
 defining a shared  o pass an additional PTModule parameter to window
             class    constructors (in certain situations).

------------------  o conditionally declare your class as either _export or
                      huge.

                    o use far pointers and far references in your
                      declarations.

                    If you declare a shared class in an include file that
                    is included by both the DLL and an application using
                    the DLL, the class must be declared _export when
                    compiling the DLL and huge when compiling the
                    application. You can do this with the _EXPORT macro,
                    which is set to _export or huge as needed when building
                    a DLL or using an .EXE with a DLL.

                      class _EXPORT TColorControl : public TControl
                      {

                      protected:
                      ...

                      public:
                      ...
                      };



                                   - 6 -






                 Macro expansion
                 =========================================

                    The _EXPORT macro expands into _export if _ _DLL_ _ is
                    defined. Borland C++ defines _ _DLL_ _ automatically
                    when you supply the -WD or -WDE options to the
                    command-line compiler, or when you specify that you are
                    building a DLL in the IDE. If you are not building a
                    DLL, then _EXPORT expands to _CLASSTYPE. _CLASSTYPE is
                    a macro that expands into "huge", "far", or "near".

                    For _CLASSTYPE to expand into "huge" (which is required
                    for classes shared between an application and DLLs), a
                    third macro is used: _CLASSDLL. You must define
                    _CLASSDLL on either the compiler command line or by
                    including it in the "Defines" edit field in the
                    compiler options dialog box of the Borland C++ IDE.
                    When defined, _CLASSDLL communicates to both the
                    compiler and to the _CLASSTYPE macro your intention to
                    use the classes being compiled as shared classes.

                    In summary, declare your shared classes with _EXPORT as
                    in the example above. Compile your DLLs with the
                    appropriate compiler directives and your classes will
                    be exported. Compile your .EXE with the _CLASSDLL macro
                    defined, and your classes will be compiled as huge and
                    will therefore be suitable for sharing with DLLs.


                 Pointers and typedefs
                 =========================================

                    You must also declare the pointers and references in
                    the header file of your shared class as far pointers.
                    You can explicitly set the pointers to far, or you can
                    use the _FAR macro to do this. _FAR is set to far only
                    when _CLASSDLL is defined.

                    ObjectWindows defines data type specifiers for each
                    ObjectWindows class using the _FAR macro. The PTDialog
                    typedef is shown here:

                      typedef TDialog _FAR *PTDialog;

                    ObjectWindows defines similar type specifiers for each
                    ObjectWindows class. Using these ObjectWindows typedefs
                    will help improve the readability of your code.

                    When referring to a pointer to an ObjectWindows class,
                    use a type whose name is P followed by the name of a
                    class. Similarly, for a reference to a class, use an R
                    followed by the name of the class. For example, a
                    pointer to a TWindow is a PTWindow. A reference to a
                    TDialog is an RTDialog.

                    All ObjectWindows classes automatically define those
                    and other typedefs that make use of the _FAR macro. To
                    automatically get those typedefs defined for your own
                    classes, use the _CLASSDEF macro at the top of your
                    header file for each class you define. For example,
                    this code

                      _CLASSDEF(TMyWindow)
                      class _EXPORT TMyWindow:public TWindow
                      {
                      ...
                      };

                    will cause PTMyWindow, RTMyWindow, and other typedefs
                    to be defined. See the documentation on _CLASSDEF in
                    Chapter 18 for details of the typedefs automatically
                    defined.

                    Due to the way the Borland C++ compiler treats classes
                    and structures, if your shared classes contain, as data
                    members, pointers to structures or other classes, you
                    may have to declare any referenced structures and
                    classes with the _CLASSTYPE macro. For example,

                      struct _CLASSTYPE TMyStruct
                      {
                      };
                      typedef TMyStruct _FAR * PTMyStruct;

                      class _EXPORT TMyClass
                      {
                         PTMyStruct ptms;
                      };

                    In the above example, TMyStruct may need to be declared
                    with _CLASSTYPE (as shown), since pointers to it are
                    contained in the huge class TMyClass. (_EXPORT implies
                    "huge" when you are compiling a DLL or compiling an
                    .EXE with the _CLASSDLL macro defined).

                    The declaration of a TColorDialog shared class and the
                    TColorControl class that it uses are shown next.

                    An RTMessage typedef is used in these declarations to
                    improve code readability and to ensure the reference is
                    a far reference when the class is used as a shared
                    class. ObjectWindows defines it as follows:

                      typedef TMessage _FAR & RTMessage;

                    Various other macros that use the _FAR macro are
                    defined by ObjectWindows in _defs.h.

                    After you've properly declared your shared class, you
                    can define its implementation in your DLL as you would
                    in an ObjectWindows application.

------------------  After declaring and defining your shared class, you
 Building a shared  need to
    class in a DLL
                    o write LibMain and WEP functions
------------------
                    o compile your DLL

                    You can copy the LibMain and WEP functions previously
                    shown to your DLL's .CPP source file, or you can use
                    your customized versions.

                    To compile your DLL, simply follow the normal
                    procedures for generating DLLs. For the command-line
                    compiler, specify either the -WDE or -WD options. For
                    the IDE, ensure you are building a DLL by checking both
                    the Options|Compiler|Entry/Exit Code and Options|Linker
                    dialog boxes for the correct DLL options. See your
                    Borland C++ documentation for general information about
                    building DLLs.

                    After you have compiled and linked your DLL, use IMPLIB
                    to generate an import library for your DLL. This import
                    library will list all exported member functions from
                    your shared classes as well as any ordinary functions
                    which you've exported.


                    To use a shared class from a DLL in your application,
------------------  you need to compile your application defining the
    Using a shared  _CLASSDLL macro (as discussed earlier). Then link your
             class  application with the import library you created for
                    your DLL. Then you can use the class defined in the DLL
------------------  as if the class had been defined by your application.

                    In the following example code, TColorDialog is executed
                    when a Color menu item is selected from TTestWindow's
                    menu:

                      void TTestWindow::CMColor(RTMessage) {
                        COLORREF TheColor;

                      ...
                        if (GetApplication()->ExecDialog(new
                                                         TColorDialog(this,
                                                         TheColor,
                                                         GetModule())) ==
                                                         IDOK)
                      ...
                      }

                    this is specified as the parent window object to the
                    constructor of the TColorDialog.

                    You could share code that defines the behavior of a
                    window (perhaps, a complex help window) or of a control
                    (perhaps a custom or drawable control). The procedure
                    outlined here applies to the definition of any Object-
                    Windows shared class.

                    You can use an ObjectWindows shared class as a base
                    class for a class that is defined in an ObjectWindows
                    application, or in another ObjectWindows DLL.


Calling an Object-
  Windows DLL from  =======================================================
   outside Object-
           Windows  Up to this point, we've assumed that the applications
                    calling your DLL were written using ObjectWindows. You
                    can also call an ObjectWindows DLL from a non-Object-
                    Windows application.

                    An ObjectWindows child window requires some support
                    from a parent window object. When a child window is
                    created in a DLL and the parent window is created by
                    the calling application, the parent-child relationship
                    must be simulated in the DLL. This is done by
                    constructing a window object in the ObjectWindows DLL
                    that's associated with the parent window whose handle
                    is specified on a DLL call. This object will be deleted
                    by ObjectWindows when the window in the calling
                    application is destroyed.

                    Note that incoming messages for the parent window are
                    first dispatched to its associated ObjectWindows
                    object. The associated object only responds to those
                    messages that support its child windows. All messages
                    are passed on to the window in the calling application.

                    In the following code, the exported function
                    CreateDLLWindow is in an ObjectWindows DLL. It is
                    assumed to be called by a non-ObjectWindows .EXE
                    (although it will work from an ObjectWindows .EXE as
                    well).

                      BOOL _far _export CreateDLLWindow(HWND ParentHWnd)
                      {
                        PTWindowsObject AParentAlias;
                        PTWindow TheWindow;

                        AParentAlias =
                      DLLHelloLib->GetParentObject(ParentHWnd);
                        TheWindow = new TWindow(AParentAlias, "Hello from a
                                                DLL!", DLLHelloLib);
                        TheWindow->Attr.Style |= WS_POPUPWINDOW |

                                                 WS_MAXIMIZEBOX;
                        TheWindow->Attr.X = 100;
                        TheWindow->Attr.Y = 100;
                        TheWindow->Attr.W = 300;
                        TheWindow->Attr.H = 300;
                        return (DLLHelloLib->MakeWindow(TheWindow) ==
                      TheWindow);
                      }

                    CreateDLLWindow is passed the handle to a window that
                    potentially might not correspond with an ObjectWindows
                    window. The call to GetParentObject returns an Object-
                    Windows object which is either the actual ObjectWindows
                    TWindowsObject (if there is one) or a surrogate object
                    created on the fly. You can use this TWindowsObject
                    instance just as though you had created it in the DLL.

                    In the above example, a child window of the supplied
                    ParentHWnd is created as a popup window.

                    Note that the DLL's module pointer, DLLHelloLib, is
                    supplied as the last parameter to TWindow's constructor
                    to provide an owning TModule for the window.



===========================================================================
Using ObjectWindows as a DLL
===========================================================================

                    To enable your ObjectWindows applications to share a
                    single copy of the ObjectWindows library, you can
                    dynamically link them to the ObjectWindows DLL. To do
                    this, you'll need to be sure of the following:

                    o When compiling, be sure to define the macro _CLASSDLL
                      on the compiler command line or in the IDE.

                    o If using any model other than large, ensure that all
                      pointers and references in class data members,
                      argument lists, and return values use the _FAR macro
                      to force far addresses.

                    o Instead of specifying the static link ObjectWindows
                      library when linking (that is, OWLWS.LIB, OWLWM.LIB,
                      or OWLWL.LIB), specify the ObjectWindows DLL import
                      library (OWL.LIB).
