ObjectWindows and Windows 3.1
===========================================================================

                    ObjectWindows has been greatly enhanced to support
                    changes in Windows 3.1. Here's a summary of those
                    changes:

                    o The ObjectWindows DLL has been renamed OWL31.DLL, to
                      avoid incompatibilities with older versions. Note
                      that the import library is still named OWL.LIB, so
                      you don't have to change your current makefiles,
                      projects, or .DEF files to use the new .DLL name.

                    o GetClassName in the following classes now returns new
                      class names, for compatibility with older versions of
                      OWL.DLL:

                      TDialog
                      TMDIFrame
                      TWindow

                    o ObjectWindows applications and ObjectWindows itself
                      can be built in several new variations:

                      - with full backward compatibility with Borland C++
                        3.0 and Turbo C++ for Windows 3.0. (See "Backward
                        compatibility: Using all your existing code,"
                        below.) When using this option, your ObjectWindows
                        applications will run under both Windows 3.0 and
                        3.1.

                      - for full compatibility with Windows 3.1. (See
                        "Windows 3.1 compatibility," below.) When you use
                        this option, you can use the new features of
                        Windows 3.1 (like multimedia and TrueType).

                      - for Windows 3.1's new Strict code style. (See
                        "Strict compatibility," below.) Strict is a new set
                        of macros and types that help you catch common
                        ObjectWindows programming errors when you compile
                        your applications, rather than waiting for bugs and
                        crashes to happen when you run them.

                    o ObjectWindows is no longer supported in the Compact
                      memory model.






                    If you have Borland C++ 3.1, you can also its other new
                    features like 80386 code generation, the Object Data
                    calling convention, and the Borland Resource Compiler
                    and Resource Linker. Naturally, you can also use
                    features from Borland C++ 3.0, like global
                    optimizations, too.


          Backward  =======================================================
    compatibility:
    Using all your  This version of ObjectWindows contains the classes and
     existing code  members to be compatible with Borland C++ 3.0 and Turbo
                    C++ for Windows 3.0. All the code you've written that
                    calls ObjectWindows member functions will still compile
                    and run fine.

                    All you have to do to use this option is to define the
                    macro WIN30 before you include the owl.h header file.
                    There are three ways to do this:

                    o If you use the Borland C++ command-line compiler, add
                      "-DWIN30" (without the quotes) to the beginning of
                      your command line. For example, you might compile a
                      module like this:

                      BCC -WE -DWIN30 myprog.cpp owlws.lib tclasss.lib

                    o If you use any of the IDEs, add "WIN30" (without the
                      quotes) to the Options|Compiler|Code Generation|
                      Defines input box. For example, if you already define
                      a macro DEBUG in this input box, adding WIN30 would
                      look like this:

                      DEBUG;WIN30

                    o You can also add "#define WIN30" in your source code
                      before you include owl.h. For example,

                      ...
                      #define WIN30
                      #include <owl.h>
                      ...

       Windows 3.1  =======================================================
     compatibility
                    ObjectWindows is also fully compatible with Windows 3.1
                    and the Windows 3.1 windows.h header file. Using this
                    option lets you use new Windows 3.1 features like
                    multimedia. Note that although Windows 3.0 applications
                    run under Windows 3.1 without change, changes to the
                    Windows 3.1 windows.h header file do require some
                    changes to your code. Many Windows API functions now
                    take slightly different argument types. Converting your
                    code to those new argument types is quite simple; for
                    more details, see the online Help API reference and the
                    online document WIN31.DOC.

                    As when you use the WIN30 macro, all you have to do to
                    use this option is to define the macro WIN31 before you
                    include the owl.h header file. There are three ways to
                    do this:

                    o If you use the Borland C++ command-line compiler, add
                      "-DWIN31" (without the quotes) to the beginning of
                      your command line. For example, you might compile a
                      module like this:

                      BCC -WE -DWIN31 myprog.cpp owlws.lib tclasss.lib

                    o If you use any of the IDEs, add "WIN31" (without the
                      quotes) to the Options|Compiler|Code Generation|
                      Defines input box. For example, if you already define
                      a macro DEBUG in this input box, adding WIN31 would
                      look like this:

                      DEBUG;WIN31

                    o You can also add "#define WIN31" in your source code
                      before you include owl.h. For example,

                      ...
                      #define WIN31
                      #include <owl.h>
                      ...

            Strict  =======================================================
     compatibility
                    ObjectWindows is also Strict-compliant; the advantages
                    you get when using Strict are well worth the changes
                    you need to make in your code. We do recommend that you
                    start converting your code to Strict. For details about
                    Strict, see the online document WIN31.DOC.

                    Note that you must use the WIN31 macro to use Strict.
                    The macro you need to define is STRICT. The three ways
                    to define these macros:

                    o If you use the Borland C++ command-line compiler, add
                      "-DWIN31;STRICT" (without the quotes) to the
                      beginning of your command line. For example, you
                      might compile a module like this:

                      BCC -WE -DWIN31;STRICT myprog.cpp owlws.lib
                      tclasss.lib

                    o If you use any of the IDEs, add "WIN31;STRICT"
                      (without the quotes) to the Options|Compiler|Code
                      Generation|Defines input box. For example, if you
                      already define a macro DEBUG in this input box,
                      adding WIN31;STRICT would look like this:

                      DEBUG;WIN31;STRICT

                    o You can also add "#define WIN31" and "#define STRICT"
                      in your source code before you include owl.h. For
                      example,

                      ...
                      #define WIN31
                      #define STRICT
                      #include <owl.h>
                      ...
