ObjectWindows for C++
===========================================================================

                    This file contains important information about
                    ObjectWindows for C++, an application framework that
                    will ease the development of applications for Windows.
                    For the latest information about ObjectWindows for C++,
                    the accompanying example programs, and documentation,
                    read this entire file.

              Note  There are many changes and enhancements to
                    ObjectWindows in this release, to better support
                    Windows 3.1. For more details, see OWL31.DOC.


          Features  =======================================================

                    ObjectWindows for C++ includes the following important
                    features:


------------------  DDVTs provide a simple alternative to the traditional
  Dynamic Dispatch  method of writing a window procedure to responding to
    Virtual Tables  Windows messages. Typically, a window procedure
           (DDVTs)  consists of a lengthy switch statement with a case for
------------------  every Windows message to which you require a response.
                    By using DDVTs, you respond to a Windows message by
                    writing a member function of the C++ class associated
                    with your window. Using DDVTs, your derived classes
                    will not be encumbered with virtual table entries for
                    all windows messages handled by the derived class and
                    all base classes. DDVTs encode only the changed virtual
                    member functions to keep virtual tables small.


------------------  ObjectWindows includes support for streamable
       Support for  (persistent) objects. The stream manager lets you save
streamable objects  objects either in memory or file streams so that they
------------------  persist beyond their normal lifespan.


------------------  The Borland Windows Custom Control Library (BWCC.DLL)
    Borland custom  provided with this release allows you to build your own
          controls  Windows programs using the fancy dialog boxes and
------------------  controls provided with such Borland Windows products as
                    the Resource Workshop, Turbo Pascal for Windows, Turbo
                    C++ for Windows, and Borland C++ for Windows.


------------------  ObjectWindows provides the ability to produce your own
      Dynamic-link  ObjectWindows DLLs and use classes and functions from
  libraries (DLLs)  these DLLs in your ObjectWindows applications.
------------------
                    In addition to OWL31.DLL, this version includes dynamic
                    link library versions of BWCC (Borland Windows Custom
                    Controls), and BC30RTL (the Borland C++ run-time
                    libraries within a DLL). More information on these
                    appears below.


------------------  We provide Help files containing reference information
       Online Help  on the ObjectWindows and Streamable classes. The Help
------------------  files are provided in two formats: one that is
                    compatible with THELP and the DOS IDE and one that is
                    compatible with the Windows Help engine (WINHELP).


------------------  To significantly improve the performance of dynamic
       Global heap  heap allocations under Windows, the BC RTL provides new
     suballocation  versions of the farmalloc, farfree, farrealloc, and
------------------  farcalloc functions which suballocate Windows global
                    heap blocks. To take advantage of these functions, you
                    need only use 'new' and 'delete' as usual.


         Important  =======================================================
       information


------------------  The User's Guide includes a step-by-step tutorial that
     ObjectWindows  quickly introduces readers to many of the important
      User's Guide  features of ObjectWindows and gets them off to a good
------------------  start in ObjectWindows programming.

                    In OWL\DOC, you will also find a file, OWLDLL.DOC, that
                    contains a new chapter on using and building dynamic
                    link libraries.

                    The BWCC-OWL.DOC file in OWL\DOC, and BWCCAPI.RW and
                    BWCCSTYL.RW files in BORLANDC\DOC contain information
                    on using the Borland Custom Controls with
                    ObjectWindows.

                    If you have any questions that are not answered in the
                    manuals, check out this file and the HELPME!.DOC
                    file, which discuss questions and problems that
                    ObjectWindows programmers may encounter.


------------------  The Borland Windows Custom Control Library (BWCC.DLL)
    Borland custom  is provided with this release, along with its import
          controls  library (BWCC.LIB). To use BWCC, you must specify the
------------------  Windows class name of any control you want to use in
                    your resource files.

                    Whether you use BWCC from an ObjectWindows program or
                    not, you will have to ensure that BWCC.DLL is
                    dynamically loaded along with your program. The
                    suggested way to do this is to update your program to
                    make a call to BWCCGetVersion (defined in
                    BORLANDC\INCLUDE\BWCC.H) from somewhere within your
                    program. This will cause an imported reference to
                    BWCC.DLL which will, in turn, cause the Windows loader
                    to load BWCC.DLL along with your program (if it is not
                    already loaded).

                    The CHECKERS and TTT (TicTacToe) games in the
                    OWL\EXAMPLES directory use the Borland Windows Custom
                    Controls.

                    See the files BWCC-OWL.DOC in the OWL\DOC subdirectory
                    and BWCCAPI.RW and BWCCSTYL.RW files in BORLANDC\DOC
                    for more information on using the Borland Custom
                    Controls.


------------------  If you use DLLs, remember that they must be located in
       DLL support  a directory in your path (eg, C:\BORLANDC\BIN or
------------------  C:\WINDOWS) or in the directory of the .EXE which
                    invokes them.

                    By default, the INSTALL program will place OWL31.DLL,
                    BC30RTL.DLL, and TCLASS31.DLL in your BORLANDC\BIN
                    directory and BWCC.DLL in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM
                    directory.

                    If you want to build the example programs to use the
                    statically linked libraries rather than OWL31.DLL (the
                    default for the makefile in OWL\EXAMPLES), you should
                    define the USESTATIC macro on the make command line:

                         make -DUSESTATIC

                    If you are using OWL31.DLL, or any ObjectWindows DLL
                    that you have built, you must use large model for both
                    the DLLs and the EXEs that use them. Also, if you link
                    your program to you use OWL31.DLL, then it should also
                    be linked to use BC30RTL.DLL and TCLASS31.DLL;
                    CRTLDLL.LIB and TCLASDLL.LIB are their import
                    libraries.

                    If you want to build your own DLLs with ObjectWindows,
                    we recommend that you check out the USECDLL and CALLDLL
                    example programs.

                    The USECDLL example program demonstrates the use of a
                    cooperating ObjectWindows EXE and DLL using an object
                    interface (that is, shared classes). The CALLDLL
                    example program shows an ObjectWindows EXE making a
                    call into an ObjectWindows DLL using a functional
                    interface. The USECDLL2 shows a non-OWL EXE calling
                    into an ObjectWindows DLL.

                    If you want to define your own shared classes, define
                    the _CLASSDLL macro in the Defines text box of the
                    Options|Compiler|Code Generation dialog box or on the
                    compiler command line to signify that the module being
                    compiled will use classes in a DLL or will pass classes
                    into a DLL. Other macros, notably _CLASSTYPE, _EXPORT,
                    and _FAR, will check to see if _CLASSDLL has been
                    defined.

                    Use the _EXPORT macro (defined in
                    OWL\INCLUDE\OWLDEFS.H) in the definitions of your
                    shared classes. It will expand into either '_CLASSTYPE'
                    (when compiling an .EXE file) or '_export' (when
                    compiling a .DLL module). Typical usage might be:

                         _CLASSDEF(TMyClass)
                         class _EXPORT TMyClass
                         {
                              // whatever...
                         };

                    The _CLASSTYPE macro (defined in
                    BORLANDC\INCLUDE\_DEFS.H) expands into either "huge",
                    "far", or "near" as appropriate. If the __DLL__ or
                    _CLASSDLL macro is defined, _CLASSTYPE expands into
                    "huge", since huge classes are required when classes
                    are passed between an EXE and a DLL or between two DLLs
                    (a huge class is a class which has a far 'this' pointer
                    and a far virtual table pointer).

                    External functions that are exported from a library
                    when it is built as a DLL should be declared with
                    _EXPFUNC. This macro is defined in OWLDEFS.H and
                    expands into '_export' when the source it appears in is
                    compiled for a DLL(-WDE or -WD would be used if built
                    with the command line compiler); otherwise, _EXPFUNC is
                    replaced with the null string. For example, the
                    following declaration appears in the APPLICAT.H header
                    file:

                         extern PTApplication _EXPFUNC
                                GetApplicationObject();


                    Note that ObjectWindows DLLs may only be built in large
                    model.

                    Also note that, if you build an ObjectWindows
                    application (.EXE) that uses one or more ObjectWindows
                    DLLs, you must dynamically link your EXE with
                    OWL31.DLL, TCLASS31.DLL, and BC30RTL.DLL. You cannot
                    statically link your EXE with the OWLWx.LIB static link
                    libraries.

                    More information on DLLs appears in the OWLDLL.DOC file
                    in OWL\DOC.


------------------  We provide the complete source code and makefiles
       Source code  needed for building the ObjectWindows (static and
------------------  dynamic link) libraries. When building the
                    ObjectWindows libraries yourself, the .OBJ files
                    produced will be placed in appropriate subdirectories
                    of OWL\OBJECT by the makefile.

                    For example, the .OBJ files for the small memory model
                    will be put in OWL\OBJECT\WS, while those for large
                    model DLL will be placed in in OWL\OBJECT\DL.

------------------  The OWL\EXAMPLES subdirectory contains many sample
   Sample programs  programs that will help you get started in writing
------------------  ObjectWindows programs. The 'test' apps are typically
                    short programs providing code samples that demonstrate
                    various ObjectWindows classes and their features; these
                    often correspond to discussions in the User's Guide.

                    The longer, more useful and interesting apps include
                    MFILEAPP (an MDI editor), SWAT (a game), and PROGTALK
                    (a DDE client that can add items and groups to the
                    Windows program manager (a DDE server)). The TTT
                    (TicTacToe) and CHECKERS examples make use of the
                    Borland Windows Custom Controls. Using a dialog as a
                    main window of a program is demonstrated in the SYSINFO
                    (system information), CALC (calculator), and CURSOR
                    (window information) examples.

                    We provide a MAKEFILE for building the examples. You
                    may want to use this as a template for writing your own
                    makefiles. The MAKEFILE uses a make include file,
                    MAKEFILE.INC, which defines the macros used by the
                    makefiles in OWL\EXAMPLES and its subdirectories. If
                    you installed ObjectWindows under your BORLANDC
                    directory (the default), and if your BORLANDC
                    subdirectories use the default names (BIN, INCLUDE,
                    LIB, CLASSLIB), then you will only have to redefine the
                    BCROOT macro within MAKEFILE.INC to use these
                    makefiles.

                    The OWL\EXAMPLES subdirectory also contains project
                    (.PRJ) files for building the sample programs with the
                    IDE. If you didn't use the standard directories when
                    you installed Borland C++ or ObjectWindows, and you
                    want to build example programs that come with .PRJ
                    files, you may have to change the .PRJ file to reflect
                    your actual directory setup. Do this from in the IDE
                    with the Options|Directories dialog box.


------------------  The OWL directory contains a batch file BUILDOWL.BAT
      Building the  which you can use to build both the class libraries and
     libraries and  the ObjectWindows libraries. This batch file invokes
       sample code  the makefile in the OWL\SOURCE directory.
------------------
                    If you installed Borland C++ in a directory other than
                    the default (C:\BORLANDC), you will need to change the
                    macro definition

                         BCROOT=c:\borlandc

                    in the makefiles to use that other directory.

                    The install program installs ObjectWindows, by default,
                    in C:\BORLANDC\OWL. The makefiles are currently set up
                    to assume ObjectWindows was installed in the directory
                    OWL under your Borland C++ directory (the macro
                    BCROOT). You will need to update the OWLROOT macro
                    (which defaults to $(BCROOT)\OWL) in all the makefiles
                    to read:

                         OWLROOT=d:\owl

                    (or wherever) if you told INSTALL to place
                    ObjectWindows somewhere else.

                    These changes are necessary to enable the makefile and
                    the compiler to find the appropriate include files and
                    libraries that are needed to build your ObjectWindows
                    programs. If you do not want to edit the makefile to
                    make this change, you can redefine these on the make
                    command line; for example,

                         make -DBCROOT=d:\borlandc -DOWLROOT=d:\owl

                    would change the definitions of the BCROOT and OWLROOT
                    make macros to he example programs each have a project
                    file. After you have opened a project in the IDE, you
                    should check the Options|Directories dialog; you may
                    have to change part of the INCLUDE and LIB selections
                    if C:\BORLANDC is not the directory in which you
                    installed Borland C++.

                    If you are in a directory containing source or sample
                    code, you can build it by simply running

                         make

                    To build the programs using the static link libraries
                    for a specific memory model, use

                         make -DUSESSTATIC -DMODEL=x

                    where x is one of s, m, or l. The makefiles in the
                    OWL\EXAMPLES directory default to small model when the
                    ObjectWindows static libraries are used and to large
                    model when the ObjectWindows DLL is used.

                    To build the examples using OWL31.DLL, use

                         make -DMODEL=l -DUSEDLL

                    or simply,

                         make

                    (the USEDLL macro is defined by default; if USEDLL is
                    defined, MODEL is defined to be l).

                    Note that only large model can be used with
                    ObjectWindows DLLs (including OWL31.DLL).

                    To build the code with debug information turned on, use

                         make -DDEBUG

                    Building with debug information can be very useful. If
                    you have built the libraries with debug info, you will
                    learn a great deal about how the class hierarchy works
                    and interacts if you step through your programs in TDW.

                    To build the ObjectWindows DLL (OWL31.DLL), use the
                    following command line in your BORLANDC\OWL\SOURCE
                    directory:

                         make -DMODEL=l -DDLL


                    For faster compilations, we recommend that you use the
                    precompiled headers option. You can add this to a
                    makefile, by adding

                         -H

                    to the CFLAGS macro in the makefile.

   Other important  =======================================================
             notes
                    o You should always use the & and | operators (or &=
                      and |= operators) when modifying Attr.Style for your
                      window objects. Windows relies on certain values to
                      always be present in Attr.Style for certain controls
                      and ObjectWindows will automatically set the proper
                      styles; if you override the values that ObjectWindows
                      puts there, you might be setting an invalid value.
                      For example, the following code is illegal:

TMyListBox::TMyListBox(PTWindowsObject AParent, int AnId,
                       int X, int Y, int W, int H, PTModule AModule)
             :TControl(AParent, AnId, NULL, X, Y, W, H, AModule)
{
  Attr.Style = LBS_NOTIFY;
}

                      It should be:

TMyListBox::TMyListBox(PTWindowsObject AParent, int AnId,
                       int X, int Y, int W, int H, PTModule AModule)
             :TControl(AParent, AnId, NULL, X, Y, W, H, AModule)
{
  Attr.Style |= LBS_NOTIFY;
}

                    o Note that correct usage of the transfer mechanism for
                      TComboBox and TListBox differs somewhat from transfer
                      buffer usage for otherwindow objects. The
                      CBXTTEST.CPP and LBXTTEST.CPP example programs
                      demonstrate the correct usage of the transfer
                      mechanism with TComboBoxData and TListBoxData.

                    o The TListBox members functions for single-selection
                      list boxes are inherited by TComboBox and can also be
                      used by combo boxes.
