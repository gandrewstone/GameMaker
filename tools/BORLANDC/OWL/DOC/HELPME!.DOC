      Building OWL  =======================================================
          programs
                    Q: What compiler options do I build OWL programs with?
                    A: For OWL applications that do not use DLLs, you can
                       use the "Windows all functions exportable", "Windows
                       explicit functions exported", or "Windows smart
                       callbacks" options in the Options|Compiler|
                       Entry/Exit code dialog box (these correspond to the
                       -W, -WE, and -WS command line options of BCC,
                       respectively). If your OWL application uses DLLs,
                       you must use smart callbacks and you must build in
                       large model. When building a DLL, you may use either
                       "Windows DLL all functions exportable" or "Windows
                       DLL explicit functions exported" (which correspond
                       to -WD or -WDE, respectively) and your DLL must be
                       in large model. Note that "smart callbacks" and "DLL
                       explicit functions exported" are preferred. The
                       OWL\EXAMPLES directory contains .PRJ project files
                       for building OWL programs; eg, CHECKERS.PRJ uses
                       OWL31.DLL, DLLHELLO.PRJ builds an OWL DLL, and
                       CALLDLL.PRJ builds a program that uses DLLHELLO.DLL.

                       Also, if you intend your program to use OWL31.DLL
                       (ie, you link with the OWL.LIB import library), you
                       must define the _CLASSDLL macro when you compile;
                       you do this by adding "_CLASSDLL" in the "Defines"
                       text box in the Options|Compiler|Code Generation
                       dialog box in the IDE (or with the -D command-line
                       option). This definition ensures that all classes
                       are 'huge' (far 'this' and far vtable pointers). A
                       common error is to fail to provide the _CLASSDLL
                       definition when you link with OWL.LIB; this will
                       result in linker errors saying 'undefined symbol'
                       for many OWL functions.


                    Q: What settings should I put in my program's module
                       definition (.DEF) file?
                    A: You do not need to provide module definition files
                       for your Windows programs when they are built with
                       Borland C++. If a .DEF file is not present, the
                       linker provides reasonable defaults. We do provide a



                                                                          1






                       file, OWL.DEF, located in your OWL\LIB subdirectory,
                       that provides the same settings as the TLINK
                       defaults. If you need to change the default
                       settings, copy this file and make your changes in
                       the copy.

                       Similarly, you do not need to provide a .DEF file
                       for DLLs that you write because the linker provides
                       defaults in that case as well. If the default values
                       are not appropriate, you can use the file OWLDLL.DEF
                       in OWL\LIB as a template for your .DEF file. Note
                       that this file is different from the file of the
                       same name in OWL\SOURCE which is used to build
                       OWL31.DLL.


                    Q: Why do I get a linker errors such as "Linker Error:
                       Unable to open file 'DLLHELLO.LIB'" when I attempt
                       to build the CALLDLL.EXE or the USECDLL.EXE example
                       programs?
                    A: The linker error indicates that an import library is
                       not present. These programs must be linked with the
                       import libraries of the DLLs that they call
                       (DLLHELLO.DLL and CDLGDLL.DLL, respectively). The
                       reason for the error is that the import library does
                       not exist because the DLL has not yet been built.
                       Building the DLL using the makefile or the
                       associated .PRJ file will result in the import
                       library being automatically created for you.


     Debugging OWL  =======================================================
          programs
                    Q. Why do I get an Error message box when I run my
                       program?
                    A. The message box will appear if an error occurred
                       during the creation of a Window element. This may
                       indicate that you are low in memory. Very often this
                       message appears when you attempt to create an
                       element that depends on information in your resource
                       template script (.RC) file and the identifier for it
                       in your source code does not have a matching item in
                       the .RC file; be wary of typographical errors.


                    Q. Why do I get an Unrecoverable Application Error when
                       I run my program?

                    A. Typically, this error is reported when memory is
                       used incorrectly. You may be using a pointer
                       containing an invalid address.

                       You may be using an invalid window handle; for
                       example, you attempt to send a message to a window
                       before it has been created or after it has been
                       destroyed. Remember that, when you construct a (C++)
                       object representing a (Windows) element, the element
                       does not yet exist. You initialize the window object
                       in the constructor but you should not try to
                       initialize the window element until the call to
                       SetupWindow (or, on rare occasions, near the end of
                       Create).

                       Another place where errors are made is in the
                       creation and execution of modal dialog boxes. You
                       first create the dialog object using 'new', and then
                       execute it using the ExecDialog member function of
                       your application object, as in the following:

                          TDialog *MyDialog = new TDialog(this,
                                                          "DialogName");
                          GetApplication()->ExecDialog(MyDialog);

                       'ExecDialog' invokes the object's 'Execute' member
                       function but first calls 'ValidWindow'. Always
                       create window objects (including dialog and control
                       objects) with 'new' (ie, from the heap) because
                       'delete' is called on the window object pointer when
                       the corresponding window element is destroyed.


       Running OWL  =======================================================
          programs
                    Q. Why do I get error dialog boxes from Windows when I
                       attempt to run my program?
                    A. If you built your program to use a DLL, then that
                       DLL must be located in the same directory as the EXE
                       that uses it, in the Windows directory, in the
                       Windows system directory, or in a directory in your
                       path. If this is not the case, Windows will put up a
                       message indicating that it cannot find the DLL. By
                       default, OWL31.DLL, TCLASS31.DLL, and BC30RTL.DLL
                       are placed into your BORLANDC\BIN directory by the
                       INSTALL program; unless you specify otherwise,
                       BWCC.DLL will be placed into your WINDOWS\SYSTEM
                       directory.



                                                                          3






                       Also, take care that you are using the correct
                       versions of DLLs required by your EXEs. If you
                       modify and rebuild a DLL, make sure that the new DLL
                       is in your path and found before any older versions
                       of the DLL on your search path; your application may
                       crash doing otherwise correct code if an older
                       version of your DLL is in your path and found before
                       a new version.


                    Q. Why do I get a message saying "Error: Cannot
                       establish DDE link to DDE server" when I attempt to
                       run the PROGTALK example program?
                    A. If you started this program from the DOS command
                       line by typing "win progtalk", then you will get
                       this message. This example program attempts to use
                       the program manager as its DDE server. When the
                       program is invoked via "win progtalk", Windows loads
                       PROGTALK before PROGMAN, and the DDE initialization
                       fails.


   Other questions  =======================================================

                    Q. What is the difference between a child window in
                       ObjectWindows and a WS_CHILD window?
                    A. In Windows, WS_CHILD is a style for a window that is
                       confined to the client area of a parent window.

                       This child-parent relationship is not the same as
                       the child-parent model used to describe
                       relationships between windows in ObjectWindows
                       (though there are conceptual similarities).

                       In ObjectWindows, a child window is an interface
                       element that is managed by another interface
                       element. A child window is displayed only when its
                       parent window is displayed. For example, a dialog
                       box is a child window managed by the window that
                       spawned it. When you close its parent window, the
                       child window automatically closes.

                       An ObjectWindows child window MAY have a WS_CHILD
                       style, though it is not required to be.

                       For more information on the child-parent
                       relationship in ObjectWindows, see the ObjectWindows
                       User's Guide. For more information on the WS_CHILD

                       Microsoft Windows Programmer's Reference.


                    Q. If I am porting a program from ObjectWindows for
                       Pascal (OWLP) to ObjectWindows for C++ (OWLC), what
                       are the differences that I will need to know?

                    A. The object hierarchies for OWLP and OWLC are similar
                       but you will want to note the following differences:

                    o The 'TMDIFrame' class in OWLC corresponds to the
                      'TMDIWindow' object in OWLP.

                    o The 'TMDIClient' object in OWLP is derived from
                      'TControl' while the 'TMDIClient' class in OWLC is
                      derived from 'TWindow'.

                    o The 'TDlgWindow' object in OWLP does not have a
                      corresponding class in OWLC. However, all of its
                      functionality is contained within TDialog. If you are
                      porting an OWLP application to OWLC, interpret all
                      references to 'TDlgWindow' as 'TDialog'. For an
                      example of how to use a dialog as a main window,
                      check out CALC.CPP in the OWL\EXAMPLES\CALC
                      subdirectory.
