                                                Borland Windows Custom Controls



            The Borland Windows Custom Controls (BWCC) is a collection of
            stylish custom controls that implement the look and feel of
            Borland-style Windows dialog boxes, such as the dialog boxes in
            Resource Workshop and Turbo Pascal for Windows.



            =================================================================
            BWCC custom controls
            =================================================================

            o Bitmapped push buttons

              These controls use bitmaps to implement the behavior of
              standard windows push buttons. They also implement two
              enhancements over Windows standard buttons.

            o Static bitmaps

              These controls implement a "non-pushable" bitmap style for
              displaying "splash" images.

            o Radio buttons

              These radio buttons implement the behavior of standard Windows
              radio buttons and auto-radio buttons but are in a more
              attractive style than standard Windows radio buttons.

            o Check boxes

              These check boxes implement the behavior of standard Windows
              check boxes and auto-check boxes but are in a more attractive
              style than standard Windows check boxes.

            o Group boxes

              These controls provide areas that appear to be cut into the
              "chiseled steel" background. Other controls can be placed on
              these areas. Gray panels themselves are "static" controls,
              meaning that the user does not interact with them at run time.

            o Dips and bumps

              These thin lines act as vertical and horizontal dividers within
              a dialog.

              - Dips (derivation: speed dip) separate areas within a dialog.
                (Borland uses them to separate push buttons from the rest of
                the dialog's controls.)

              - Bumps (derivation: speed bump) separate areas within a group
                box.

            o Custom dialog class

              The Borland custom dialog class does two things:

              - It paints the dialog window background with a brush
                appropriate to the display device--speckled (chiseled steel)
                for monitors with VGA capabilities and higher, white for EGA
                and monochrome.

              - It optimizes dialog drawing by taking over from the custom
                controls and drawing them directly on the surface of the
                dialog window. This "turbo painting" allows Borland's dialogs
                to implement a sophisticated look without a sluggish feel.



            =================================================================
            Using BWCC or Custom Buttons in a program
            =================================================================

            Using BWCC in an ObjectWindows program is easy.

            1. In your C++ source files use the ObjectWindows BWCC "TB"
               classes (presented later) in place of their plain "T" analogs.
               Be sure to include the requisite BWCC header files.

            2. In resource files, edit dialog entries to specify Windows
               class "BORDLG".

            3. To ensure that BWCC.DLL will be dynamically loaded along with
               your program, include a call to BWCCGetVersion (defined in
               INCLUDE\BWCC.H) somwhere in your application. By




            Page 2



               convention, the call to BWCCGetVersion is in your application
               class's InitMainWindow member function.

            4. Link your program with the import library LIB\BWCC.LIB.
               You must link BWCC.LIB with your program before you link
               IMPORT.LIB.

            5. Make the dynamic link library BWCC.DLL available to your
               application to use at run time (in addition to OWL31.DLL). For
               Windows to find it, it must be in one of the following places:

               o The same directory as your application's .EXE file

               o The Windows startup directory

               o The Windows system directory

               o A directory on your PATH



            =================================================================
            Using Borland dialogs
            =================================================================

            Borland dialogs must have their resource's Windows class set to
            "BORDLG". Such a dialog may be referred to by a conventional
            ObjectWindows TDialog class. Note that there is no TBDialog
            class.




            =================================================================
            TBButton                                                BBUTTON.H
            =================================================================

            Derived from TButton.

            TBButton is an interface class that represents a BWCC bitmap push
            button interface element. You must use a TBButton to create a
            button control in a parent TWindow. You can also use a TBButton
            to facilitate communication between your application and the
            button controls of a TDialog.

            There are two types of push buttons. A regular button appears
            with a thin border. A default button appears with a thick border
            and represents the default action of the window (if user presses
            Enter). There can only be one default push button in a window.

                     NULL);

            Constructs a button object with the supplied parent window
            (AParent), control ID (AnId), associated text (AText), position
            (X, Y) relative to the origin of the parent window's client area,
            width (W), and height (H). Invokes TButton's constructor with
            similar parameters. Adds BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON to the default styles
            set for the TBButton (in Attr.Style), if IsDefault is TRUE.
            Otherwise, it adds BS_PUSHBUTTON.

            Constructs a TBButton object to be associated with a button
            control of a TDialog. Invokes the TButton constructor with
            identical parameters; the TButton constructor calls
            DisableTransfer to exclude the button from the transfer mechanism
            because they have no data to be transferred.

            The ResourceId parameter must correspond to a button resource
            that you define.

            TBCheckBox                                              BCHKBOX.H
            =================================================================

            Derived from TCheckBox.

            TBCheckBox is an interface object that represents a BWCC check
            box interface element in Windows. You must use a TBCheckBox to
            create a BWCC check box control in a parent TWindow. You can use
            a TBCheckBox to facilitate communication between your application
            and the check box controls of a TDialog.

            Check boxes have two states: checked and unchecked. Three-state
            check boxes have an additional grayed state. TBCheckBox member
            functions are concerned primarily with managing the check box's
            state. Optionally, a check box can be part of a group (TGroupBox)
            that visually and functionally groups its controls.

              functions

                       X, int Y, int W, int H, PTGroupBox AGroup,
                       PTModule AModule = NULL);

            Constructs a check box object with the specified parent window
            (AParent), control ID (AnId), associated text (ATitle), position
            (X, Y) relative to the origin of the parent window's client area,
            width (W), height (H), and associated group box (AGroup).
            TBCheckBox::TBCheckBox invokes a TCheckbox constructor which sets
            the check box's Attr.Style data member to WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE |
            WS_TABSTOP | BS_AUTOCHECKBOX.

            =================================================================

            Derived from TControl.

            A TBDivider is an interface object that represents a static BWCC
            divider. Dividers come in two flavors: dips and bumps. Dips
            separate areas within a dialog. Bumps separate areas within a
            group box.

            width (W) and height (H). By default, the static control is
            visible upon creation. Adds one of BSS_VBUMP, BSS_VDIP,
            BSS_HBUMP, or BSS_HDIP to Attr.Style depending on the values of

            TBGroupBox                                              BGRPBOX.H
            =================================================================

            Derived from TGroupBox.

            An instance of a TBGroupBox is an interface object that
            represents a corresponding gray BWCC group box element.

            Group boxes don't serve an active purpose onscreen. They visually
            unify a group of selection boxes (check boxes and radio buttons)
            or other controls. Behind the scenes they can take an important
            role in handling state changes for their group of controls
            (normally check boxes or radio buttons).

            For example, you may want to respond to a selection change in any
            one of a group of radio buttons in a similiar manner. You can do
            this by deriving a class from TBGroupBox that redefines the
            member function SelectionChanged.

            Alternatively, you could respond to selection changes in the
            group of radio buttons by defining a response for the group box's
            parent. To do so, define a child-ID-based response member
            function, using the ID of the group box. The group box will
            automatically send a child-ID-based message to its parent
            whenever the radio button selection state changes.

            Constructs a group box object with the supplied parent window
            (AParent), control ID (AnId), associated text (AText), position
            (X, Y) relative to the origin of the parent window's client area,
            width (W), and height (H). Invokes the TGroupBox constructor with
            similar parameters, which modifies Attr.Style by removing
            WS_TABSTOP. The TBGroupBox constructor then removes BS_GROUPBOX
            and adds BSS_GROUP to Attr.Style. NotifyParent is set to TRUE in
            the TGroupBox constructor; by default, the group box's parent

            group boxes from the transfer mechanism because they have no data
            to be transferred.

            =================================================================

            Derived from TRadioButton.

            A TBRadioButton is an interface object that represents an
            attractive BWCC radio button element. Use TBRadioButton to create
            a radio button control in a parent TWindow. A TBRadioButton can
            also be used to communicate between your application and the
            radio button controls of a TDialog.

            Radio buttons have two states: checked and unchecked. Optionally,
            a radio button can be part of a group (TGroupBox) that visually
            and logically groups its controls.
