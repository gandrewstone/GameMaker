      PLANETARY COALITION

    For  many years your solar
system has  lived  in harmony,
with each planet  minding  its
own orbit, and not  disturbing
the others.

    You thought that your life
as  a  solar  flare  would  be
peaceful,   and    uneventful,
until the summons  came.   You
have  to  appear  before   the
coalition    of  planets,  and
accept their charge.

    The chamber  was full when
you  arrived.     Yannic,  the
little    earth-like    planet
currently  orbiting  at  8:00,
and Zenom, the large gas giant
(orbiting outside of Yannic at
7:00)   were  quietly  talking
with Syin, your mother star.

  "I'm glad you arrived!" Syin
said warmly.
  "Why  was I sent  for?"  you
ask.
  "We are in grave danger.   A
haloed  sun    in    the  1:30
direction is on  the  verge of
super-nova.  If the  star goes
our   entire  system  will  be
engulfed!    I  charge  you to
carry the green  gem of energy
and place it on  a dias in the
bowels of this sun.  The green
gem  is  located  deep  inside
Zenom,  but   I   suggest  you
visit Yannic first  to prepare
yourself.  Will you accept the
charge?"
  "I  will  humbly  obey," you
say quietly.
  "Good.   Good Luck.  You may
go now  to  prepare  for  your
journey."
