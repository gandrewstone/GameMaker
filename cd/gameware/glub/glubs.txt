
You are a happy fish, living
in Glubada Pond.  Still, you
wish you could have more room
to play around in -- the pond
just isn't big enough.  You
decide to wander off, in
search of the largest body of
water you can find.  It
shouldn't bee too hard with
the magical vending machines
lying around.
