The Bureau of World Water 
Works supplys the world with 
sparkling clear water.  At
least, it used to.

Underground where the water is
'worked', a lot of mopping up
is desperately needed.  Stop
the water leaks, avoid or wipe
out vermin, collect valuables.

Luckily, the vermin have
collected a pile of gold which
is yours if you can reach it.
But first you must find the
way out of the first level and
then fight to the end of the
second level.
