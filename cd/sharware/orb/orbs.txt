    Some day in the future

The silence was broken vividly
by loud static, and then a low
voice.
 "Chara 4........"
Someone sat erect and began to
listen.
 "Chara 4.....Chara 4.......Is
anyone there?  Hello..........
I'm hailing the planet Chara 4
.......Is anyone there?"
 "This is Chara 4.  Who hails
the planet Charanaphan?"
 "I need to speak with someone
in charge of your military..."

 Quiet hysteria  hung over the
mechanical  world  of Chara 4.
A nervousness  hung about each
and every  one of  the world's
intelligent  machines.  In one
particular  place,  one  large
group of  Orb's,  as they  are
popularly  described by  their
alien allies,  waited with the
most  acute panic  anywhere to
be found.  Many  beings talked
or  whispered,   pretended  to
joke, or  just hung  about the
hall in silence.  

 It  was then  that  a  fairly
important Orb  rolled into the
hall and collected  the silent
attention of  the entire group
which  waited.    Another  Orb
followed behind  and waited to
one side.

 "One of  you will be selected
to either  save our  world  or
debunk a hoax.  Either way, it
will be  one of you,  who have
been noticed for some personal
valor or special strengths."

 The Orb paused.

 "Apparently,  some  scavenger
alien has  found  himself on a
abandoned  world where the old
machines  seem to  still be in
operation.   According  to he,
the old mainframe computer has
selected us  (for some unknown
reason) as a  threat to  those
who no  longer live there."

"It, again according to he, is
constructing,  by  process  of
energy-to-matter   conversion,
weaponry to launch  at us, and
while  we  are  confident   we
could fend off such a  strike,
the  computer could send more.
We need  to strike this system
down at its heart and end this
threat."

 The Orb  swiveled  to  regard
the second Orb who had entered
with him.   He turned  back to
the crowd.

 "Our scientist fellow here, a
researcher  of our  aggressor,
has received  some information
from a probe he sent there, as
well as depositing some of our
most  potent  weaponry.   This
information has been placed in
the  ship that  will transport
you  to  the planet,  but  the
weapons have  been noticed and
captured  by the enemy.   When
you land,  you'll need to find
them to use 'em, fighting your
way, apparently,  through many
multitudes  of small creatures
and large and  trained or bred
creatures.   In the cities you
will meet  more advanced auto-
mated adversaries,  and traps,
no doubt, as well."

 After several  weeks of tests
one  Orb had  been selected to
penetrate  the defenses of the
derelict  world.   He  is You!
Your  ship will  proceed  to a
home-made  transport  warp and
within a  minute  you  will be
closing  in on the enemy world
below.  Good Luck.
