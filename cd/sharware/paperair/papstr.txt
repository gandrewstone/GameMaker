After  several    unsuccessful
inventions,     you    finally
discover  something  useful, a
miniaturized radio control and
remote TV camera system.

You had  just  completed  your
patent application papers  for
it   when  you  received    an
anonymous  call  that informed
you  that   a  company  called
XEMTX had stolen your idea and
was applying for a  patent  on
it  too.   If Xemtx  gets  the
patent  to  the  patent office
first, they'll  get  your idea
patented under their  name and
will  get all the  money  from
it.  

Xemtx is located only 20 miles
from  the patent office, while
you  live  over 900 miles from
it.   Floods  have knocked out
many  nearby  bridges, so get-
ting  to  the patent office in
your car  would be impossible.
There are no  airports  in  or
near  the puny town  that  you
live in.  Your fax  machine is
broken.  The mail would be too
slow.    In  desperation,  you
make  your  patent application
papers  into  a paper airplane
and  attach your radio control
and remote TV camera system to
it.  After  attaching a motor,
propeller,      and    control
surfaces, you're ready to fly.
