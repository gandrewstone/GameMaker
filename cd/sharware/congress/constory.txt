     PROGRESS OR CONGRESS?

    The congressmen are
coming!  They've entered the
city with but one thought on
their minds: "get money get
money get money"!

    Everyone has run for their
lives!  Besides a few stores
and other working places, the
city is deserted!

    ...except for you!

    Only you are left to
locate the Majority Leader and
stop his taxing of the city!

    Fight through The City,
buzz through InflationLand,
sneak through the IRS Office,
climb out of RecessionLand,
and stop the Majority Leader
once and for all!

          Good Luck!
    (...you'll need it...)
