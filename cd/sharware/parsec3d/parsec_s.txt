         PARSEC MAN 3D

Somewhere in the system of XON
(pronounced "zon"), there is a
power crystal which gives the
bearer ultimate power.  Not
many have ever dared to try to
find it, however, because a
dangerous race of creatures,
called the OCTAXON, live
there.  The OCTAXON are
creature who can live
anywhere, including space,
because they need no oxygen.
Hence, anywhere one travels in
the system, they are attacked.

PARSEC, however, is a very
daring adventurer, out to
capture the crystal.  PARSEC
wears a jetpack suit armed
with a powerful energy bolt
emmitter that can instantly
vaporize one of the OCTAXON.
He also has a plasma bolt
emmitter, which must be fed
power to work.

PARSEC quickly checked a
description of the four
planets of XON:

XON-1 *** Point of interest:
Orbital Asteroids.  XON-1 has
a dense asteroid belt which no
ship can pass through.
Readings of a powerful energy
source have been found there,
as well as the remains of an
alien starbase.

XON-2 *** Point of interest:
Surface.  XON-2's surface has
the remains of an old alien
town.  A crystal may be found
there.

XON-3 *** Point of interest:
Oribital Station.  A starbase
was set up to find the power
crystal.  A crystal was said
to be found, but then all life
was destroyed in the station
and the station fell apart.

XON-4 *** Point of interest:
Caves.  A cave was discovered
which had zero gravity.  The
face that the planet is Zero-G
indicates the presence of a
power source.

PARSEC knew that there are
three duplicate crystals that
must be found.  These crystals
are the only way to unlock a
mechanism which is said to
keep THE power crystal from
being taken.

He was all set.  He quickly
took off in his jetpack suit
to the system of XON, in
search of glory...
